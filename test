79667499		> Doesnt have all cards
Miranda fits the profile, but is female.  Barring a clever disguise, should not be considered a suspect.
56892213		> Dont have all cards
Questioned Daniel Sinker about his whereabouts yesterday.

He's tall enough to be a suspect, but he drives a Subaru, not a Honda, and the license plate doesn't match.
9620713		> Possible sus, need to eliminate other sus - mystery/people:Jeremy Bowers	M	34	Dunstable Road, line 284
Home appears to be empty, no answer at the door.

After questioning neighbors, appears that the occupant may have left for a trip recently.

Considered a suspect until proven otherwise, but would have to eliminate other suspects to confirm.
